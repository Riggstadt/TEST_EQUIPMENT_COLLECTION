# TEST_EQUIPMENT_COLLECTION

This repo contains several circuits intended for measuring very-low currents and for generating simple ramp waveforms with low component count.

Current measurement:
- <a href="Circuits_for_low_current_measurements.pdf">Circuits for low current measurements</a>, intended as a showcase of various approaches to current measurement.\
- <a href="">Low-side current sensing</a>, a more thorough analysis of the circuit's structure and capabilities

Ramps:
- <a href="Ramp_Generator_Principles.pdf">Ramp generator</a>, simple, yet effective ramp generator, for use with parameter extraction
